<p>以下为英文原文：</p>
<p>For many, Thorstein Veblen is a seer with an ethical and aesthetic message;for others, he is simply an iconoclastic social scientist.Although Veblen’ssignificance is still widely disputed, his ideas of conspicuous consump-tion, display and emulation have been shown to have relevance in explain-ing not only class hegemony but also consumer behaviour,corporatepredation, international politics, militarism, sport and fashion. Moreover,Veblen can be credited with explaining the link between ostentatiousdisplay and the oppression and subjugation of women.</p>
<p>Political sociologists and theorists of modernization respond sensitivelyto such Veblenian ideas as ‘the penalty for taking the lead’ in industrial-ization, the notion of 'trained incapacity’ and the idea of ‘conscious with-drawal of efficiency’. Veblen is also recognized by sociologist RobertMerton (1949: 69-70,153-4) for his contributions to the theory of latentand manifest functions still so popular in sociology. He has received atten-tion for his ideas regarding social stratification and the sociology of know-ledge. Finally,sociologists and social critics such as C. Wright Mills(1953: vii-xix) often refer to his critique of social institutions and theirlinks with corporate power centres. Veblen’s theoretical and doctrinalarsenal as a dissenter in his own time from neoclassical economics andmainstream sociology thus provides an emulatory model for a new gener-ation of social scientists.</p>
<p>Veblen was born into a Norwegian-American family in the upperMidwest. He was the son of immigrant farmers, and like most of his sib-lings he was sent to Carleton College in Minnesota. There, he receivedtraining in economics under John Bates Clark,who later became aneminent neoclassical economist. After receiving his bachelor’s degree at Carleton,Veblen taught for a year and then enrolled at Johns Hopkins for graduate study, where he was a student of the philosopher C.S. Peirce andthe economist Richard Ely. After a short stay, he moved to Yale, where he Finally, in 1891, he obtained a graduate position at Cornell University,where he once again became a PhD candidate. The eminent economist J.Laurence Laughlin liked him, and in 1892, when Laughlin moved to theUniversity of Chicago, he took Veblen with him. Veblen soon became man-aging editor of the Journal of Political Economy, a position he held from 1896to 1904, and started to publish in the field of economics. In 1899, his mostfamous book, The Theory of the Leisure Class, appeared and achieved a noto-riety all its own.However, Veblen’s personal eccentricities, radicalism andfailure to 'advertise’ the university properly, angered the administrationat Chicago and he was compelled to move.His next job was at Stanford,where, in a few short years, he encountered similar difficulties, exacer-bated by his ‘womanizing’ . He was forced to move again, this time to theUniversity of Missouri. During the First World War,Veblen worked brieflyin Washington, DC as an employee of the Federal Food Administration.After the war, he served as one of the editors of the Dial, a journal of liter-ary and political opinion, and as a member of the faculty of the newlyfounded New School for Social Research in New York City. By then, eventhough his reputation as a scholar and publicist had reached its apex, hisacademic career was at an end. Veblen retired and moved to California,where he died shortly before the start of the Great Depression (Tilman,1992,1996).</p>
<h3 id="veblens-sociological-economics"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#veblens-sociological-economics"></a> Veblen’s Sociological Economics</h3>
<p>During the 30 years that he held academic posts at Chicago, Stanford, Mis-souri and the New School for Social Research,Veblen became the mostinfluential and best-known dissenting social scientist in the USA.Veblen’sheterodoxy was widely recognized by professional economists and soci-ologists after the publication of The Theory of the Leisure Class, in which hedeveloped his theory of status emulation. In this satirical study of theleisure class and the underlying social strata which emulate it, he arguedthat conspicuous consumption,conspicuous waste and ostentatiousavoidance of useful work were practices by which social status <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://wasenhanced.In">wasenhanced.In</a> short,Veblen contended that individual utility preferencescould not be understood except in relation to the utility preferences ofothers because individuals were emulating others in order to strengthen Veblen’s rejection of neoclassical value theory did not end in nihilism,however, for he outlined an alternative to both neo-classicism and classicalMarxism. He wrote of the ‘generic ends’ of life ’ impersonally considered’and of ‘fullness of life’ ; in his evolutionary, that is, Darwinian mode ofanalysis, this implied the existence of some transcultural set of values. Hefound these values embedded in workmanship, parenthood and intellec-tual curiosity, all of which flourish in a properly developing society. Veblenmeant that proficiency of craftsmanship, altruism and critical intelligencewere dominant values and processes in communities that were developingin a non-invidious manner. However,in communities that were not sodeveloping, these 'instincts’ or propensities would be contaminated bytheir opposites, the pecuniary and sporting traits which were invidious.Veblen’s second book, The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), containshis explanation of business cycles and an extended treatment of thecultural and social psychological significance of the machine process.Con-trary to conventional analyses of business cycles, Veblen saw no naturalequilibrating tendencies in the American economy. Instead, he argued thatinstability was endemic in the American business system because of exces-sive capitalization and credit inflation. His analysis focused on the ten-dency of firms to borrow too much by exaggerating their future earningpower. At some point, their creditors would recognize that loans made tothese firms were unwarranted because their earning power was less thananticipated. The loans would then be called in, with the inevitable conse-quences of liquidation and bankruptcy. A protracted period of depressionwould follow, characterized by large-scale unemployment and unusedindustrial capacity. Gradually, however, the earning power and creditrating of the firm would move towards convergence and recovery wouldoccur. A period of prosperity would then ensue until over-capitalization and credit inflation recurred and the cycle began anew.Veblen anticipatedthat the growth of monopoly and wasteful government expendituresmight check cyclical instability,but his disciples looked to the socialcontrol of industry and better economic planning to offset the deficienciesof the system.</p>
<p>Much of Veblen’s reputation as a radical dissenter was based on his cri-tique of classical and neoclassical economics. Included in his analysis ofthe received economic theory and doctrines was a rejection of the follow-ing: (i) hedonism and utilitarianism; (ii) the static bias of price theory; (iii)the taxonomic method and (iv) the infection of economics with teleology.Veblen labelled these deficiencies’pre-Darwinian’- that is, rooted in a pre-evolutionary mindset which had not yet come to terms with the scientificrevolution of which Darwin was the chief catalyst. Veblen criticized thehedonistic and utilitarian theory for portraying humankind as passiveagents reacting to external forces only when impinged upon.His readingin cultural anthropology convinced him that humanity was active ratherthan quiescent and that, in any case, the Benthamite claim that pleasureand pain were the 'sovereign masters of us all’ was merely tautological.When Veblen accused eminent neoclassicists such as his former teacherJohn Bates Clark and Irving Fisher of mere ‘taxonomy’ he was, of course,charging them with mistaking classification,inventory-taking andlabelling for genuine scientific explanation, which in his view dealt pri-marily with the establishment of causal relationships. Indeed,Veblen’sessentially negative view of neoclassicism rested on his belief that it failedto move beyond the taxonomic stage of inquiry.</p>
<p>Veblen attacked the static bias of neoclassicism because it was unable toaccount for change.General and partial equilibrium theory failed tocapture the flux of evolutionary processes, including both changes in themarket mechanism and the underlying institutions which direct andchannel exchange.Finally, Veblen criticized neoclassicism for its retentionof the residues of teleology, which so badly infected classical economics.His most often-cited example was the neoclassical claim that equilibriumconstitutes a 'normal state’ of affairs towards which markets inevitablyand invariably tend.</p>
<p>However, the central feature of Veblen’s work as a dissenter was not hiscritique of neoclassicism, his contribution to business cycle theory or evenhis important theory of status emulation. Instead, what most set him offfrom the conventional paradigm was his development and use of thedichotomy between business and industry, what his disciples were laterto call the ‘ceremonial-technological dichotomy’. They and Veblenemployed it as an analytical device, as an approach to the larger problemof value in economics and as part of a theory of social <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://change.In">change.In</a> his usage,the business-industry dichotomy was extended to include salesmanship</p>
<p>As an economic historian and sociologist of growth,Veblen is bestknown for his ‘institutionalism’, a term coined by Walton Hamiltonduring the First World War. In one sense, the term is misleading becauseit was existing institutions which Veblen criticized because of their inhib-itive impact on technological change. In his theory of cultural lag, hedeveloped the idea that institutions are inhibitory and backward-looking,whereas science and technology are dynamic and orientated towardschange.The question at any point in time is whether institutions are suf-ficiently malleable to permit efficient exploitation of existing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://technologicalpotential.As">technologicalpotential.As</a> the tool continuum evolves, it may become more absorptiveof cultural cross-fertilization processes which bring together more anddifferent tools, making possible new technologies. Veblen thus explainsthe economic history of the West by linking cultural anthropology andsocial history with changes in the technoeconomic base; the main variablesin his explanation are the degree of institutional rigidity and cultural mal-leability and the pressure exerted by technology.</p>
<p>Veblen’s theory of economic growth is closely linked with his ideasregarding economic waste. The rate of economic growth cannot be maxi-mized if all output is not serviceable and if efficiency is sacrificed to pecu-niary interests. The rate of maximum growth is thus governed bytechnological advance, which controls the size of the nation’s economicsurplus, although this rate is also a matter of the disposition of the surplusbetween serviceable and non-serviceable uses. In short,Veblen incorpor-ated a theory of waste - that is, unproductive consumption, investmentand labour - within his theory of social change. This permitted him toshow both the conditions under which economic growth stagnates andthose under which it will not be synonymous with the economic welfareof the community. In this way, he clarified the concept of economicefficiency and linked it with the processes of social change and non-invidi-ous economic growth.</p>
<p>In 1914,Veblen published The Instinct of Workmanship, which he believedwas his most important book. It can profitably be read as a sequel to TheTheory of the Leisure Class. Whereas the latter focused on emulatory con-sumption and display, the former outlined the aesthetic and moral aspectsas well as the economic significance of work.Veblen also largely discardedthe instinct psychology and racialism which influenced his early work. Heaccomplished this by using ’ instinct’ to mean purposive, learned behav-iour and by asserting that all Europeans were racial hybrids with little todifferentiate them in terms of their natural endowments.</p>
<p>Veblen’s massive erudition was also evident in his further developmentof the phases through which he believed humanity has evolved, includ-ing the savage, barbarian, handicraft and industrial stages.He suggestedthat what separates these stages from each other, in addition to the levelof economic development they have reached, is the degree to which preda-tory instincts have contaminated peaceful, or non-predatory, traits - inshort,the extent to which sporting and pecuniary instincts have influ-enced the instincts of idle curiosity, parenthood and workmanship.</p>
<p>Three of Veblen’s last books, The Vested Interests and the State of the Indus-trial Arts (1919),The Engineers and the Price System (1921) and AbsenteeOwnership (1923), focus on the predation and waste of the corporate capi-talist order. Writing in a more polemical style than in his earlier works,Veblen endorsed the dispossession of absentee owners and business-minded executives from the American corporation. He also recom-mended, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that engineers and technicians form analliance with workers and run enterprises <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://themselves.At">themselves.At</a> this point in hiscareer,Veblen interacted for a short time with politically progressive engi-neers, emphasizing the role they might play in the establishment of anindustrial republic. However, the many allegations by Veblen’s critics thathe was a technocratic elitist who wanted to establish an autocracy domi-nated by engineers and technicians exaggerate this element in his thought.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#conclusion"></a> Conclusion</h3>
<p>It was inevitable in his role as a dissenting sociologist and economist thatVeblen would favour large-scale changes in the capitalist order, althoughit was unusual for him to make serious policy recommendations.Whatdistinguished him from other radicals was his view of the means that wereavailable to make these changes. Orthodox Marxists still put their faith ina proletariat, whether or not it was revolutionary, but Veblen was scepti-cal of this labour metaphysic. Nevertheless, he persisted in his search foran agent of social change, a political technology and a vehicle for struc-tural change.Early in his career, he was attached to the American prole-tariat and Bellamyite socialism. Thereafter，anarcho-syndicalism in theform of the Industrial Workers of the World, a radical union, aroused hissympathies and later he spoofingly endorsed progressive engineers andtechnicians as the wave of the future. Ultimately,however,Veblenretreated into pessimism as regards the American scene, believing ‘imbe-cile institutions’ to be dominant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,Veblen’s own analysis of the social psychology of classesmakes uncertain the outcome of industrial civilization.On the one hand,the machine process has an emancipatory impact on the psyche of indus-trial workers,turning them against social convention and presumably infavour of socialism.On the other hand, status emulation infects the workingclass and serves as a social bonding agent to offset the class mentality andconflict induced by the machine process.Status emulation is in turn rein-forced by patriotism,as Veblen indicated in The Nature of Peace (1917).Would the machine process triumph and turn the working class againstcapitalism, as suggested in The Theory of Business Enterprise, or would emu-latory consumption reinforced by patriotism triumph? In the final analysis,despite his pessimism, Veblen did not know or, at least, he did not say.Estimates of Veblen’s creative contribution as a dissenting sociologistand economist vary greatly depending on the political and social philos-ophy of the critic. Most neoclassical economists who are politically con-servative find little merit in his work because they see themselvescorrectly, both as economists and as consumers, as the objects of his satire.Liberal social scientists react differently to Veblen depending on how farleft they are in the political spectrum. To illustrate, those still partly underthe influence of classical liberalism find little of value other than hishumour,while collectivist liberals often respect both his satire and hissocial theory. However, it is in advanced progressive circles and on theradical left that Veblen’s theory and doctrine meet with greatest approval,although European-trained and oriented Marxists like Paul Baran andTheodor Adorno (1941: 389-413) were very critical. Nevertheless, givenVeblen’s negative attitudes toward capitalism it is not surprising that themost cordial reception of his ideas would be in those intellectual circlesand ideological groups also critical of capitalism.</p>
<p>The creation of the Association of Evolutionary Economics and thepublication of its organ, the Journal of Economic Issues, since 1966 have pro-vided a forum for the study of Veblen and his ideas. More recently, theAssociation for Institutional Thought (1979), the European Association forEvolutionary Political Economy (1988) and the International ThorsteinVeblen Association (1993) provide evidence of the continued growth of adissenting tradition with Veblenian roots. Veblen’s theoretical and doctri-nal arsenal as a dissenter from the neoclassical paradigm in economics andmainstream sociology is thus more widely accessible to a new generationof social scientists.</p>

[00:11.50]	I have traveled more than you will know.
[00:15.50]	In the hot sun or the deepest snow.
[00:19.30]	When the winter winds, if everyone in lonely nights.
[00:26.00]	I have been to live next to alone.
[00:30.00]	With the years I made four men of straw.
[00:34.20]	But the time has passed, and I really want someone.
[00:41.00]	Not stay alone.
[00:45.50]	Lovely lady, the moment I thought you there.
[00:51.00]	I knew that could be since here.
[00:54.70]	But maybe that you don't care.
[00:59.00]	Lovely lady, I'll change all the things of my life.
[01:06.00]	If that could make you realize.
[01:09.00]	Forever I think, I like you to stay, forever.
[01:12.30]	Forever.
[01:16.00]	I wait you so long. I hardly believe, you there.
[01:24.00]	************************************************
[01:38.70]	I now wonder what could make you see.
[01:42.50]	All the feelings which are inside me.
[01:45.50]	All these things I never took the time to think about.
[01:53.00]	But I want you to know.
[01:57.00]	Lovely lady, the moment I thought you there.
[02:03.50]	I knew that could be since here.
[02:07.50]	But maybe that you don't care.
[02:11.50]	Lovely lady, I'll change all the things of my life.
[02:18.50]	If that could make you realize.
[02:21.70]	Forever I think, I would like you live, forever.
[02:27.50]	Forever.
[02:29.00]	I wait you so long. I hardly believe, you there.
[02:36.00]	Lovely lady, the moment I thought you there.
[02:42.50]	I knew that could be since here.
[02:45.00]	But maybe that you don't care.
[02:50.50]	Lovely lady, I'll change all the things of my life.
[02:57.00]	If that could make you realize.

[03:07.00]	Forever.
[03:08.50]	I wait you so long. I hardly believe, you there.
[03:22.50]	Lovely lady.
[03:30.00]	Lovely lady.
